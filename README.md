# Star wars REST API testing project

## Getting started
Just pull the repository and build it with Visual Studio. In the Test Explorer tab you can find the available tests.

## Why?
The reason why I created an API testing repository because I like to learn how the API testing is working in real life. Also what I realized that the test automation especially functional testing is moving from UI to API level due it's faster runtime and stability.

## Star Wars?
I love Star Wars, never forget my childhood first seeing the original trilogy. I didn't know that the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) existing until I had an interview with Supercharge and give me a homework to write couple of test cases based on my API knowledge. The requirements was hard to understand and I didn't get hired...tough luck, but it gives me a great idea to rework and enchance the code which is going to help me in my career.
